## Performance

Below is a graph showing the dependence of FPS on the number of simultaneously rendered objects, created under the following conditions:

- Setup: MacBook M1, 8Gb RAM
- Data: 113x113px object 
- Resolution: 200x200px

![Performance diagram](resources/perf_diag.png)

As shown on the graph, the engineâ€™s performance is above 20 FPS with <=40 objects. It is strongly discouraged to add more than this number of objects with a size similar to 113x113px on a range smaller than resolution parameters.
